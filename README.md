## #Task: 
Build machine learning models to predict if a transaction is fraudulent or not
# Description
The project aims to mitiate the problem we face in our society-credit card fraud.
I started the project by analysing the data to understand how each component relates to fraudulent activities, the most important features were selected for the final model.
The following steps where carried out;
1) Exporatory data analysis:I analyzed the data for insight
2) OverSampling to solve imbalanced dataset problem
3) pearson correlation to select most important features
4) Model Building and model summary:

Logistic Regression(accuracy-97% and recall- 94%)

Naive Bayes(accuracy-98 and recall-92%)

Decision Tree(Accuracy-99% and Recall-85%)

Hard-Voting-Classifier(Accuracy-99% and Recall-84%)

Soft-Voting-Classiffier(Accuracy- 100%)
